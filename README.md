This project has the following dependencies:

1. Python!
2. SQLAlchemy.
3. pyodbc
4. pytest
5. Any servers you're connecting to must be set up as a connection in Windows' ODBC tool.

Currently it can't compare results from two different servers, although I think this could be possible with some work.
